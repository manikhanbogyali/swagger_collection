    get:
      description: >-
        This endpoint sends a hashed Digest Authorization header to gain access to a valid `200 Ok` response code. In Postman, it uses the stored [global variables](https://www.getpostman.com/docs/environments#gloval-variables?source=echo-collection-app-onboarding), `echo_digest_realm` and `echo_digest_nonce`, to generate the hashed authorisation header.


        Within Postman, for this request to successfully authenticate, running the previous request "DigestAuth Request" stores the relevant information within the global variables.

One of Hawk's main goals is to enable HTTP authentication for services that do not use TLS (although it can be used in conjunction with TLS as well).


        In order to use this endpoint, select the "Hawk Auth" helper inside Postman, and set the following values:


        Hawk Auth ID: `dh37fgj492je`


        Hawk Auth Key: `werxhqb98rpaxn39848xrunpaw3489ruxnpa98w4rxn`


        Algorithm: `sha256`


        The rest of the values are optional, and can be left blank. Hitting send should give you a response with a status code of 200 OK.
